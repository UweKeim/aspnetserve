aspNETserve is a free and open source ASP.NET 2.0/3.x web server. Written in C#, 
aspNETserve can be used to host your ASP.NET website, or to extend your knowledge of ASP.NET. 
Best of all, aspNETserve is easy to get started with.

Additionally, it can host any ASP.NET 2.0/3.x web application without the need for Internet Information Services (IIS). 
Either use aspNETserve as a stand alone web server, or reference its libraries to embed a full featured ASP.NET
web server right into your own application. 
For more information see the system requirements.

aspNETserve makes it easy to start a web server from anywhere. The "Host in aspNETserve" context menu 
right from Windows Explorer allows you to easily experience web projects without the headache of configuring IIS.
