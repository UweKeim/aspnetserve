aspNETserve is a free and open source ASP.NET 2.0/3.x web server. Written in C#, aspNETserve can be used to host your ASP.NET website, or to extend your knowledge of ASP.NET. Best of all, aspNETserve is easy to [get started](GettingStarted.md) with.

Additionally, it can host any ASP.NET 2.0/3.x web application without the need for Internet Information Services (IIS). Either use aspNETserve as a stand alone web server, or reference its libraries to embed a full featured ASP.NET web server right into your own application. For more information see the [system requirements](SystemRequirements.md).

aspNETserve makes it easy to start a web server from anywhere. The "Host in aspNETserve" context menu right from Windows Explorer allows you to easily experience web projects without the headache of configuring IIS.
